## ðŸ§­ My Philosophy of Life  

> The world is made up of two kinds of people: those who work with their hands and those who work with their brains
> Iâ€™m a **brain worker** â€” a thinker and a builder
> I believe in working hard on the invisible â€” logic, ideas, and systems â€”  
> to create something real and impactful 
> My mission is simple: keep learning, keep building, and keep evolving  
> until my work speaks louder than my words
