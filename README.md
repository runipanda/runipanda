## ðŸ§­ My Philosophy

> The world is made up of two kinds of people: those who work with their hands and those who work with their brains.  
> Iâ€™m a **brain worker** â€” a thinker and a builder. I believe in working hard on the invisible â€” logic, ideas, and systems.  
> My mission is simple: keep learning, keep building, and keep evolving until my work speaks louder than my words.
